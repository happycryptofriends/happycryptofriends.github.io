      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We don't collect your data and we don't store your data. That's it.</p>
      <p>We simply have nothing to collect and nowhere to store. No cookies, no Google Analytics or something.</p>
      <p>So, even if Elon Musk would offer us a fly to Mars to get your data, we wouldn't have anything to give him.</p>
      <p>However, this is a public website hosted on GitHub, so you may want to check their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">Privacy Statement</a></p>
